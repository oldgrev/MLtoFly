 DCS World UH-1H Deep Learning using Stable Baselines 3 and Gym custom environments...badly.
 
 V2 training running now with as-yet normalized observation space. V3 will be with a normalized observation space for comparison.


DCS World output via export.lua => python => pyvjoy => vjoy => DCS World Input
                                => telemetry file to csv
                                => periodic model + tf logs
